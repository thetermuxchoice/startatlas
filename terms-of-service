<p><em><strong>Last Revised on September 29, 2022</strong></em></p>
<p>Welcome to the Terms of Service (these “<strong>Terms</strong>”) for the website <a href="https://staratlas.com">https://staratlas.com</a> (the “<strong>Website</strong>”), the Star Atlas game (the “<strong>Game</strong>”), and all content and functionalities accessible via our Website and the Game (including the Star Atlas Wallet, as defined below) other than the Star Atlas DAO (as defined below) (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>”), in each case operated by or on behalf of ATMTA, Inc. (“<strong>Company</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” or “<strong>us</strong>”), a Delaware corporation. For clarity, the Services do not include the operations of the Star Atlas DAO or any websites relating thereto.</p>
<p>These Terms govern your access to and use of the Services. Please read these Terms carefully, as they include important information about your legal rights. By accessing and/or using the Services, you are agreeing to these Terms. If you do not understand or agree to these Terms, please do not use the Services.</p>
<p>For purposes of these Terms, “<strong>you</strong>” and “<strong>your</strong>” means you as the user of the Services. If you use the Services on behalf of a company or other entity then “you” includes you and that entity, and you represent and warrant that (a) you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and (b) you agree to these Terms on the entity’s behalf. </p>
<blockquote class="info-box"><b>Section 9 contains an arbitration clause and class action waiver.

<h3>1. SERVICES; WALLETS; ACCOUNTS</h3>
<ol class="inner-list" start="1">
<li><u>Description of the Services</u>. The Services offer a unique metaverse gaming experience via the Game and other related experiences through the combination of traditional core game and blockchain mechanics via the Solana blockchain (the “<b>Star Atlas Metaverse</b>”). The Star Atlas Metaverse is driven by a dual token system — “ATLAS” and “POLIS.” ATLAS serves as the native in-Game currency used for in-Game economic interactions, such as purchasing resources, ships, repairs, stations, and other in-Game assets. POLIS is a multifunctional governance token, which has applications both in-Game and in influencing decision making by the decentralized autonomous organization that governs the Star Atlas Metaverse (the “<b>Star Atlas DAO</b>”). Further information about the Star Atlas DAO can be accessed at the website <a href=https://govern.staratlas.com>https://govern.staratlas.com</a>. While we may provide services to the Star Atlas DAO at its request to create, facilitate, or service certain aspects of the Star Atlas Metaverse, we do not control the Star Atlas DAO and are not responsible for its decisions or actions. You acknowledge and agree that we cannot be held liable or responsible in any way for any damages or losses incurred by any person in connection with any acts or omissions of the Star Atlas DAO. Further details on the Star Atlas Metaverse, including the uses of ATLAS and POLIS, are set forth in the Star Atlas Economics whitepaper, currently available at <a href="https://staratlas.com/assets/pdfs/economics-paper.pdf">https://staratlas.com/assets/pdfs/economics-paper.pdf</a>, as we may update from time to time.</li>

<li><u>DACs</u>. The Star Atlas Metaverse utilizes a guild system that allows you to create factions and collectives that operate within the Star Atlas Metaverse in a decentralized, autonomous way (“<b>Decentralized Autonomous Corporations</b>”). The Services may provide you and other players with certain tools that enable the implementation and management of such Decentralized Autonomous Corporations. We reserve the right to revoke access from any Decentralized Autonomous Corporation, or member player thereof, to such tools in the event that such Decentralized Autonomous Corporation or player violates these Terms or for any other reason we determine in our good faith business judgment.</li>

<li><u>Game Items</u>. The Services provide access to a marketplace (the “<b>Marketplace</b>”) for you to purchase, transfer, and trade Game-related items such as ships, stations, resources, posters, and other items (collectively with other Game-related assets, attributes, or characteristics, whether or not transferable or tradeable, “<b>Game Items</b>”); provided that any Game Items that we indicate are “soulbound” to you shall be non-transferable and non-tradable (including with respect to any Game NFTs associated with such Game Items) from the Digital Wallet that such Game Items are first stored (“<b>Soulbound Items</b>”). Game Items can be used in the Services in various ways that we or the Star Atlas DAO make available, such as to represent in-Game assets that you can use while you play the Game. We make no promises or guarantees regarding the functionality, utility, or value of any Game Items, and such Game Items may evolve and change as we or the Star Atlas DAO update and modify the Game and the Star Atlas Metaverse.</li>

<li><u>Game NFTs</u>. Your purchase of Game Items may be accompanied by non-fungible tokens (“<b>NFTs</b>”), and your ownership of these NFTs is tracked via the Solana blockchain (“<b>Game NFTs</b>”). Your ownership of these Game NFTs will give you certain rights and privileges within the Services, for as long as we make the Services and such rights and privileges available to you. You are responsible for all payments, fees, and costs when engaging in any transactions involving Game NFTs, including, without limitation, the purchase price, transaction fees, fees associated with your secondary or subsequent sales of Game NFTs, and all other fees associated with your use of the Game NFTs via the Services.</li>

<li><u>Marketplace</u>. We provide the Marketplace to be able to sell Game Items and other Services-related offerings (collectively, “<b>Offerings</b>”) to you directly from us. The Marketplace will also facilitate peer-to-peer sales conducted via decentralized or third-party exchanges or protocols whereby buyers and sellers can buy, sell, and trade Game NFTs (other than Soulbound Items) with each other. We may charge a transaction fee on all peer-to-peer sales that occur via the Marketplace or that otherwise involve Game NFTs (which may be calculated as a percentage of the overall sale price of the Game Items). We may offer ways to receive a discount on such transaction fees, such as by holding or staking certain Services-related tokens and assets. The scope of, and pre-requisitions for receiving any, such discount offers are subject to change by us in our sole discretion at any time. To facilitate transactions via the Marketplace, we have integrated with one or more third-party exchanges and services, such as the Serum exchange protocol, or other decentralized smart contract protocols. These protocols facilitate, on a peer-to-peer basis, the exchange of cryptocurrency and other assets through the Solana blockchain. We do not own or control these third-party or decentralized services, we do not control the transfer of cryptocurrency or digital assets, including Game NFTs, using these third-party services or decentralized services, and we do not have the ability to cancel or reverse transactions via the Marketplace. You acknowledge and agree that, to the extent that you transfer, trade, or receive, or attempt to transfer or trade or receive, a Soulbound Item, in each case the Services will not associate the Soulbound Item with the recipient or any person that has a different Digital Wallet than that under which the Soulbound Item was first obtained. Except as may otherwise be provided in these Terms, we do not control or endorse purchases or sales of Game NFTs or other Offerings outside of the Services, including the Marketplace. With respect to Game NFTs that are not sold directly by us, we are not a party to any agreement entered into between an end user buyer and a seller on the Marketplace. Other than with respect to items sold directly by us, we have no control over the conduct of buyers, sellers, and any other users of the Marketplace. We accept no liability for any aspect of the buyer and seller peer-to-peer interaction on the Marketplace.</li>

<li><u>Digital Wallets</u>. To use certain of the Services, you need to link to the Services via a non-custodial digital wallet made available by either us (a “<b>Star Atlas Wallet</b>”) or one or more third parties (a “<b>Third-Party Wallet</b>”), and that is compatible with the Solana network and the Services (each, a “<b>Digital Wallet</b>”). A list of supported wallets may be displayed by us, such as on the Website. Linking a Digital Wallet to the Services is required to be able to purchase, store, and engage in certain transactions using the Services, such as to connect your Game NFTs and ATLAS and POLIS tokens with the Services. We may not be able to help you recover assets associated with your Digital Wallet, as these are non-custodial wallets in your control. We do not own or control the assets associated with your Digital Wallet. We accept no responsibility or liability to you in connection with your use of a Digital Wallet and make no representations or warranties regarding how the Services will operate with any specific Digital Wallet. The private keys, credentials, passwords, seed phrases, or secret recovery passphrases necessary to decrypt or gain access to a Digital Wallet are held solely by you, and not by us. If you choose to transfer items from one Digital Wallet to another, such transfers will occur on the public blockchain and we accept no liability or responsibility for any such transfer, including for any loss, data corruption, or other negative impact that may occur to your Offerings or Digital Wallets or other assets when attempting to transfer assets between Digital Wallets. We reserve the right, with or without prior notice and in our sole and complete discretion, to discontinue, modify, or limit the operation of any Digital Wallet with the Services. You represent and warrant that you are the lawful owner of any Digital Wallet and that you are using that Digital Wallet under the terms and conditions of the applicable provider of the Digital Wallet.

<ol class="letter-list">
<li>To the extent that you use a Third-Party Wallet, the following additional terms apply: Third-Party Wallets are not associated with, maintained by, controlled by, or affiliated with us. If you have any issues with your Third-Party Wallet, please contact the applicable provider. You represent and warrant that you are the lawful owner of any Third-Party Wallet and that you are using that Third-Party Wallet under the terms and conditions of the applicable provider of the Third-Party Wallet.</li>

<li>To the extent that you use a Star Atlas Wallet made available by us, such use will also be governed by the terms of use for the Star Atlas Wallet located in Appendix A of these Terms.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><u>Promotional Codes</u>. We may offer certain promotional codes, referral codes, discount codes, coupon codes, or similar offers (“<b>Promotional Codes</b>”) that may be redeemed for discounts on future Offerings, or other features or benefits related to the Services, subject to any additional terms that the Company establishes. You agree that Promotional Codes: (a) must be used in a lawful manner; (b) must be used for the intended audience and purpose; (c) may not be duplicated, sold, or transferred in any manner, or made available by you to the general public (whether posted to a public forum, coupon collecting service, or otherwise), unless expressly permitted by the Company; (d) may be disabled or have additional conditions applied to them by the Company at any time for any reason without liability to the Company; (e) may only be used pursuant to the specific terms that the Company establishes for such Promotional Code; (f) are not valid for cash or other credits or points; and (g) may expire prior to your use.</li>

<li><u>Changes and Pricing</u>. We may, at any time, revise or change the pricing, availability, specifications, content, descriptions, or features of any Offerings sold by us, and to correct pricing errors that may inadvertently occur (and to cancel any orders in our sole discretion that were purchased with pricing errors). All such changes shall be effective immediately upon posting of such new Offerings prices to the Services. While we attempt to be as accurate as we can in our descriptions for the Offerings, we do not warrant that Offerings descriptions are accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. The inclusion of any Offerings for purchase through the Services at a particular time does not imply or warrant that the Offerings will be available at any other time. We reserve the right to change prices for Offerings displayed on the Services at any time.</li>

<li><u>Purchases Made for Consumptive Use</u>. You acknowledge and affirm that you are acquiring Offerings, whether through the Marketplace or otherwise through the Services, for purposes of use in connection with the Services and, in the case of the Game NFTs, to play the Game or for other collectible purposes, and in each case not for any investment or speculative purposes. Any economic benefit that may be derived from appreciation in the value of an Offering or Game NFT is incidental to obtaining it for its use in connection with the Services or its collectible purpose.</li>

<li><u>ALL SALES FINAL</u>. ALL PURCHASES MADE THROUGH THE SERVICES ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATION (AND IN SUCH INSTANCES WHERE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY’S ABILITY TO ISSUE ANY SUCH REFUND IS LIMITED TO WHETHER THE APPLICABLE SMART CONTRACT ENABLES THE COMPANY TO REASONABLY REVERSE OR CANCEL A TRANSACTION). NEVERTHELESS, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT IN MOST CASES HAVE THE ABILITY TO REVERSE OR CANCEL A TRANSACTION AND IS NOT REQUIRED OR OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE A REFUND OF ANY PURCHASE FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR TIME, ITEMS, AMOUNTS, OR VALUES IN A GAME ACCOUNT (INCLUDING ANY UNUSED OR PARTIAL USED MEMBERSHIP TIME), EVEN IF AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.</li>

<ol class="letter-list">

<li>We understand that part of what makes our community so great is its interest in developing tools and services that are helpful for other users of our Services and expand the Star Atlas Metaverse, such as guild directories, Game-related guides, or other Game-related creative content (“<b>User Services</b>”).

This license only lasts as long as you are the valid owner and holder of the Game NFT associated with the licensed Content. If you sell or transfer the Game NFT to another person, this license will transfer to such other owner or holder of the Game NFT, and you will no longer have the benefits of such license.

SOME JURISDICTIONS (SUCH AS THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY) DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF THOSE JURISDICTIONS. THE COMPANY ENTITIES’ TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES FINALLY AWARDED SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (I) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID THE COMPANY ENTITIES, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX (6) MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES (OR OFFERINGS PURCHASED ON THE SERVICES) GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM, OR (II) $100 USD.

You acknowledge that you have obtained sufficient information to make an informed decision to purchase a Game NFT, including carefully reviewing the code of the smart contract and the NFT, and fully understand and accept the functions of the same. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Services, and therefore the potential utility or value of your Game NFTs.

<h3>9. GOVERNING LAW; ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h3>
<ol class="inner-list" start="9">
<li><u>Governing Law</u>. These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of laws rules, and the proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to any of the same will be the arbitration venue set forth herein, or if arbitration does not apply, then the state and federal courts located in New York. You and the Company agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to the interpretation or construction of these Terms.</li>

<li><u>Informal Process First</u>. You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and the Company Entities, you will first contact the Company and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation, any court action or arbitration.</li>

<li><u>Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver</u>. After the informal dispute resolution process, any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, “<b>Claim</b>”), whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, or any other legal theory, relating in any way to your use of the Company’s services and/or products, including the Services, will be resolved by arbitration, including the resolution of threshold questions as to the arbitrability of the Claim. YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT “Claim” AS DEFINED IN THESE TERMS SHALL NOT INCLUDE ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION, DILUTION, OR OTHER MISUSE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. <b>You and the Company agree that any Claim will be settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “Rules”) then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms). Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis in accordance with the Rules. Class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND THE COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS ARBITRATION.</b> You and Company further agree: (i) to arbitrate all Claims between the parties pursuant to the provisions in these Terms; (ii) these Terms memorialize a transaction in interstate commerce; and (iii) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq.) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.  The arbitrator’s decision(s) shall be made pursuant to the Rules and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of these Terms as permitted by the governing New York law and subject to the terms and limitations in these Terms. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing agreement to arbitration:

<ol class="letter-list">
<li><u>Injunctive Relief</u>. You and the Company will have the right to bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable or conservatory relief, pending a final decision by the arbitrator.</li>

<li><u>Small Claims</u>. Any Claim which is eligible for resolution in the small claims court (or its equivalent) of the jurisdiction in which the party bringing the claim is domiciled may be brought in such small claims court or its equivalent <b>on an individual, non-representative, and non-class basis</b>. If a party initiating such a Claim is domiciled outside of the United States or in a jurisdiction which does not have small claims courts or their equivalent, any claim for less than $5000 USD may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the jurisdiction in which the party initiating the Claim is domiciled.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><u>Confidentiality</u>. You and Company agree that any Claim that has been submitted to arbitration, and all related proceedings, including any settlement agreement, shall be kept confidential. In the event you or the Company file the arbitration award with any court of competent jurisdiction in order to have that award confirmed in a court order or judgment, or any other proceeding under the Federal Arbitration Act, then each party shall take measures to the extent permitted by applicable law to redact or file under seal any highly sensitive business or personal information that appear in the award and any other supporting documents filed in such a proceeding.</li>

<li><u>Conduct of the Arbitration</u>. Any arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules, except that, if the amount in dispute exceeds $10 million USD, the arbitration shall be conducted by a panel of three neutral arbitrators appointed in accordance with the Rules. The arbitration shall have its seat in New York. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by videoconference (which you may join telephonically if you are unable to reasonably access or utilize videoconference technology), rather than by personal appearances, during ordinary business hours in the time zone in which the party initiating the arbitration resides. The arbitrator may direct that the hearing be held in person upon the request of any party if the arbitrator concludes that doing so would be appropriate under the circumstances. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the arbitrator. For the avoidance of doubt, the arbitration shall be deemed to take place in New York, and any resulting award(s) will be rendered in New York, regardless of the location or method of any hearings.</li>

<li><u><b>Opt-Out</b></u>. <b>You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration provisions set forth in these Terms by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to <a href="mailto:legal@staratlas.com">legal@staratlas.com</a> or by certified mail to the U.S. mailing address listed in the “How to Contact Us” section of these Terms. The notice must be sent to the Company within thirty (30) days of your registering to use the Services or agreeing to these Terms, whichever is earlier, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with these Terms. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, the Company also will not be bound by them.</b></li>

<h3>Appendix A: Star Atlas Wallet Terms</h3>
<p>
  These Wallet Terms of Service (these “<b>Wallet Terms</b>”) apply to your use of our Star Atlas wallet application and browser extension (the “<b>Star Atlas Wallet</b>”) made available by or on behalf of ATMTA, Inc. (“<b>Company</b>,” “<b>we</b>,” or “<b>us</b>”), a Delaware corporation. The Star Atlas Wallet is a “Service” as defined in the overall Terms of Service for the Star Atlas website, game, and related services (“<b>Service Terms</b>”). The Service Terms are incorporated by reference into these Wallet Terms. Capitalized terms used in these Wallet Terms but not defined herein will have the meaning set forth in the Service Terms. In the event of a conflict between these Wallet Terms and the rest of the Service Terms, these Wallet Terms will supersede and control with respect to your access and use of the Star Atlas Wallet. By accessing or using the Star Atlas Wallet, you agree to these Wallet Terms and the overall Service Terms.
</p>
<ol class="inner-list" start="1">
<li><u>Wallet Services</u> The Star Atlas Wallet is a digital wallet that is downloaded and accessible locally on your own device, and accessible locally by you on such device where you have installed the Star Atlas Wallet. The Star Atlas Wallet provides you with access to an interface that allows you to conduct certain transaction directly on the Solana blockchain network (or such additional blockchains as the Star Atlas Wallet may support from time to time), and to view balances of blockchain-based digital assets (collectively, “<b>Digital Assets</b>”) associated with such the private keys for such Star Atlas Wallet.</li>

<li><u>Self-Custodial Wallet</u> The Star Atlas Wallet is a “self-custodial” wallet in that you custody and control your own Digital Assets accessible through your Star Atlas Wallet. With respect to such Digital Assets, we do not own, control, or have custody of such Digital Assets, and we do not have the ability to transfer or recover such Digital Assets. We do not operate a Digital Asset exchange platform or offer trade execution or clearing services and, therefore, have no oversight, involvement, or control concerning your transactions using the Star Atlas Wallet.</li>

  <li><u>Access</u> The Star Atlas Wallet may require you to create a password to access your Digital Wallet. In certain circumstances, such as if you lose or forget your password for your Star Atlas Wallet, you may be able to use a recovery phrase or other secret information to access any cryptocurrency stored in your Star Atlas Wallet (each a “<b>Recovery Phrase</b>”). Anyone who knows your Recovery Phrase may be able to access, transfer, or spend your Digital Assets. If you lose your Recovery Phrase, you may not be able to access, transfer, or spend your Digital Assets. <b>We do not have access or control over your password or Recovery Phrase or private key for your Star Atlas Wallet. You are solely responsible for the retention and security of your password or Recovery Phrase or private key for your Star Atlas Wallet.</b></li>

  <li><u>Gas Fees</u>When conducting transactions via the Star Atlas Wallet, the applicable blockchain network charges a network fee for engaging in a transaction on the network, often referred to “gas fees.” Those gas fees fluctuate over time depending on a variety of factors. You are solely responsible for paying gas fees associated with transactions you engage in on the Solana blockchain network, or any other supported network, using the Star Atlas Wallet. You are also solely responsible for any other third-party fees that may be incurred in connection with your use of the Star Atlas Wallet.</li>

  <li><u>Third-Party Services</u> The Star Atlas Wallet may allow you to connect with third-party services and applications (“<b>Third-Party Services</b>”). We do not have control over their content, do not warrant or endorse, and are not responsible for the availability or legitimacy of the content, products, or services on or accessible from those Third-Party Services (including any related website, resources, or links displayed therein). We make no warranties or representations, express or implied, about the manner in which the Star Atlas Wallet may function with such Third-Party Services.</li>

  <li><u>Risks of Decryption</u> Although the Star Atlas Wallet cryptographically encrypts your private information when using the Star Atlas Wallet, you acknowledge and understand that technical advances such as the development of quantum computers may present risks to Digital Assets, cryptocurrencies, and encryption in general, which could result in the theft or loss of your cryptographic tokens or property. By using the Star Atlas Wallet, you acknowledge these inherent risks.</li>

  <li><u>Modifications or Discontinuance</u> We may modify, or discontinue support for, the Star Atlas Wallet at any time. In the event of a change to an underlying blockchain network, or other network disruption, resulting in a fork of the existing blockchain into one (or more) additional blockchains, the Star Atlas Wallet may not support activity related to any new Digital Assets created as a result of the fork.</li>
